# Background
Smart mobile phone use and consumption have rapidly expanded globally. There are currently more than 5 billion mobile phone users worldwide, which is expected to rise in the future year, according to a report from April 2021 (Prabhu N and Majhi, 2023). Along with the increase in demand for smartphone phone usage, the usage of mobile applications has also increased very heavily. For example, WhatsApp (A widely used messaging service app), YouTube, and Instagram have more than 1 billion downloads by combining iOS and Android users.
At the same time, their CPU, storage and communication capabilities are advancing quickly. (Barca et al., 2017) Due to the significant advance of technology and its acceptance, users consider their phones as a personal processing devices. (Qureshi et al., 2011)
With the advance of technology and superb user experience in iOS and Android, app development companies have shifted their focus on these 2 mobile Operating Systems (OS). And they are slowly stopping their support on the other mobile OS.
This paper summarizes the concept of “Mobile as a service (Maas)”, where a user may choose a virtual mobile device and install it on any phone with an on-demand mobile OS, upgrade the processing speed, increase the storage capacity, and do a lot more with it. and can make daily use of it as well as use it for mobile application development.

# Problem Statement
As discussed in the background section the usage of smartphones and their applications increased so significantly that different mobile makers have come up with significant changes to their mobile devices with additional new features to stay on top in the market.
Along with the upgradation of smartphone devices, the app development company must support their application in the newer version of mobile as well as in the Mobile OS.
With every passing year the new processor, storage facility, communication medium, the newer version of mobile OS, the features outbeat the old smartphones and their configurations.

In addition to being widely utilised nowadays, smartphones’ CPU, storage, and networking capabilities are also developing swiftly. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) addresses performance, environmental, and security challenges by superimposing cloud computing concepts over the mobile environment(Barca et al., 2017).
Personal data can be stored on and retrieved from mobile devices whenever and wherever. As a result, the mobile cloud's data security issue just gets worse and hinders it from developing further. The security of the cloud has been the subject of extensive research. However, because mobile devices only have a small amount of computational power and resources, the majority of them are not suited for mobile clouds (Li et al., 2018).
Because of the production of so many mobiles each year, the obsolete or old mobile phone waste is also increased. This leads to an increase in plastic and other materials wastes, which causes environmental damage. Mobile phone upgrades are a major factor in it. (Prabhu N and Majhi, 2023)
Finally, considering the extraordinary development in mobile applications, developers are required to provide high quality, on time, and within budget given the global demand for smartphone applications. As a result, analysing the mobile application before it is created is much more important and complex. For a multitude of reasons, including the large range of mobile devices, limited computational power, storage, and energy, and device complexity, testing mobile applications is seen as a tough undertaking.(Kulwant Kaur, 2016)
To summarize we are mostly facing a couple of significant problems.
1) users are getting attracted to newer technologies and newer versions of smartphones each year by spending a lot of money. Because of that, they are replacing the old and obsolete phones which leads to e-waste.
2) Individual App developer or App Development companies face significant challenges in accommodating all kinds of devices to test their application for market-ready.
3) Most mobile applications are using MCC, so in that case, they are storing and transacting data back and forth using API service, how secure are they?
4) Is Task Offloading in mobile the real game changer? Is it secure? can it be relied on the dynamic network condition?
5) Is the Augmentation of Smartphones being the real deal? However, there is not much of concrete application or use cases are present to rely it on?
6) Is testing mobile apps on the cloud are cost-effective?

# Research Questions (If any)
There are lots of individual app developers plus app development companies that are making smartphone apps for the user to support in their smartphone. Android and iOS are the 2 biggest smartphone mobile OS available in the market and they are mostly used. iOS is not open source but their devices are costly when in terms of Android is Open source and most of the mobile makers use Android in their mobile and customize it to their branding. To support mobile apps in these phones and make it ready for production developers are required to test their mobile apps on physical devices. Since these smartphone screen sizes are standard but inside there their configurations(such as RAM, processor
capability, volume and other similar features) are not standard to each phone. Hence it is very difficult for individual developers and App Development companies to accommodate all these phones for their development needs. Can we leverage the power of Cloud Computing (CC) and Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) to come up with solutions that help primarily the individual app developers and the app development company?

# Aims and Objectives
The main objective of this project is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud technologies to offer a solution that will be sustainable and widely accepted.
The following are the study's stated objectives, which serve as the foundation for the research goals:
1) Discuss various types of mobile devices, the mobile OS to support, and their configurations.
2) Compare the functioning difference between widely used two mobile OS (Android and iOS) and their device capabilities.
3) Understand the impact of rapid changes in mobile devices and their configurations and features on regular users and app developers.
4) Enhance and improve the memory (RAM) of smartphones with the help of Mobile cloud computing.
5) Analyse the system and propose a more robust and easily available solution by leveraging the power of Cloud Computing.

# Significance of the study
Cloud Technologies has been around for quite some time. Cloud technologies are being increasingly adopted in different areas of work, for example, education, hospitals, research work, gaming, office and many more areas. With increasing internet usage across the globe, many things have become accessible to everyone at everywhere.
capabilities of different services provided by cloud provider and their implications to propose an idea for Mobile as a service (Maas)which can be accessed anywhere on any device and at a very low cost, so that users can choose the appropriate device for their specific scenarios. These are now fit into the human’s pocket with a pocket-sized device called a mobile. And MCC played a significant role here in making we humans connect with the world all the time. These smartphones are extremely pricey and given the nature of technology involved with these devices, it is getting unaffordable at some time.

# Scope of the study
In this research we will understand the Mobile OS, Mobile Memory, Processor, and battery and how these are the few things that help to run the mobile device globally.
Then we will try to understand how exactly we can propose and extend the concept of Maas and how one can benefit from this by leveraging the power of Cloud computing
For example, let’s say we are targeting 2 Mobile OS (Android and iOS) and currently to use any of the OS we need to purchase the specific device later we want to move away from 1 ecosystem to another then we must buy another mobile device. Given the challenges of the existing system, this study primarily focuses on the cloud environment and mobile cloud computing to propose an idea for MaaS.

# Research Methodology
The world has been moving towards network-based computing over the past few years thanks to developments in information technology. Users are requesting applications and services via the Internet in increasing numbers. Due to the enormous demand for applications and expansion, the idea of cloud computing was first introduced (Armbrust et al., 2010). The Internet is entering a new phase of development thanks to cloud computing, which includes the delivery provision of hardware, software, and application services online. Technically speaking, it is a group of computers or servers that are used to provide Internet services. Since 2007, research on cloud computing has grown significantly in the scientific and business areas. The following services, according to Cloud Times, will be the most useful in cloud computing (Amin et al., 2013a). Numerous techniques exist that offer mobile cloud computing solutions, and we classify them into two categories(Qureshi et al., 2011):
                      A) General-purpose mobile cloud computing
                      B) Application-specific mobile cloud computing

### Mobile Cloud Computing
The Open Gardens blog defined mobile cloud computing as the accessibility of cloud computing services in a mobile ecosystem in March 2010. (Amin et al., 2013a). Combining mobile computing, the Internet, and cloud computing is known as mobile cloud computing (Qureshi et al., 2011). Consumers, businesses, femtocells, transcoding, end-to-end security, home gateways, Wi-Fi networks, WiMAX networks, and broadband networks are all included in mobile cloud computing (Amin et al., 2013b).

<img width="475" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jdhalmahapatra/mobile-as-a-service/assets/64486289/d4497ac0-23ad-4110-a12a-5fa1d78fdeb8">

To provide services, mobile cloud computing integrates users, businesses, transcoding, end-to-end security, Wi-Fi networks, and broadband networks [8]. Dynamic networks, application service providers, regional and global network infrastructure, developers, and end users are all part of mobile cloud computing, as shown in Figure 1.1 and linked by the Internet [7]. A system is created in general-purpose mobile cloud computing (GPMCC) that utilises the cloud infrastructure to improve the functionality of mobile devices. To access a certain resource or program on demand, it is critical to obtain the label for a mobile device via the Internet. Numerous particular programmes may be utilised for this, but why not employ these resources more broadly to improve the limited computational capacity of mobile devices? (Qureshi et al., 2011).
To understand the MCC in a better way look at the above Figure 1.1 diagram, Users from different network providers will try to access the service from their respective network providers with the help of respective access points. Access points may consist of Antenna, Satellite, etc. These Access points then take the requests of the users and route them to the Network channel. Then these intermediate network medium with the help of the Internet tries to connect to the cloud environment fetch the response of the request and pass it to the users.

### Virtual Mobile
On the desktop level, remote desktop integration already exists and is widely utilised in a variety of industries, including IT, government, gaming, etc. On smart devices, virtual mobile (VM) will gain popularity. Mobile customers demand the same operating system (OS) functionality on their smart mobile or smart devices as they do on their desktop computers. By enabling desktop functionality, personal computers will no longer be used. Mobile virtualization will give consumers flexibility and mobility while also increasing productivity for the company. To use their suggested clone cloud architecture to boost the hardware performance of constrained smartphones. We can shift task execution to these devices by creating virtual copies of the smartphone execution environment on the cloud. By hosting clones of smartphones, it is possible to load an execution infrastructure from a smartphone. With the help of this if the smart phone is lost or damaged then we can recover it from the back up. Other advantages of this are that we can overcome the hardware limitation of low- end smartphones. Also, this feature is going to help individual developers and app development company to focus building apps and test it on physical device without worrying much of buying physical assets.
